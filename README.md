## Boat Image Classification
The dataset was found from https://www.kaggle.com/clorichel/boat-types-recognition.
A Jupyter Notebook is included where the files coded on the local Spyder environment
were merged to run on Google Cloud.  Commented out lines show different attempts or segments 
of the program that are still in development.  To test different iterations and fine tune 
the model, each function was run several times under different parameters.
